# Weather Dashboard

A simple web application that allows users to search for and view the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

**Visit this page to see the result:** https://drunkpotato.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Features

*   Search for weather data by city name.
*   Displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, description, icon).
*   Provides a 5-day weather forecast.
*   Includes sliders for forecast days with multiple time points to view details for specific times.
*   Basic error handling for invalid city names or API issues.
*   Responsive layout for different screen sizes (verify your CSS supports this).

## Technical Notes

*   Built with standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
*   Utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for fetching weather data.
*   Employs the browser's `fetch` API for making asynchronous network requests.
*   Uses JavaScript Promises (`async/await`, `Promise.allSettled`, `.then()`, `.catch()`) to manage asynchronous operations.
*   Dynamically manipulates the DOM to display fetched weather information and create UI elements like forecast cards and sliders.
*   Processes and structures API data for user-friendly presentation (e.g., grouping forecast entries by day).

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure, including the search input, button, and containers for displaying weather data.
*   `style.css`: Defines the styling rules for the visual presentation and layout of the dashboard.
*   `script.js`: Handles all the client-side logic:
    *   Attaching event listeners to user interface elements.
    *   Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input.
    *   Processing the received JSON data.
    *   Updating the HTML (DOM manipulation) to show the current weather and forecast.
    *   Handling potential errors during the process.

## Learning Takeaways

This project served as practical experience in several key web development areas:

*   **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Making API calls with `fetch` and effectively handling the asynchronous nature using Promises (`.then`, `.catch`) and `async/await`. Understanding `Promise.allSettled` for concurrent requests.
*   **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with HTML elements using JavaScript to dynamically display data and update the user interface based on API responses.
*   **Event Handling:** Capturing user input through event listeners (`click`, `keydown`) to trigger application logic.
*   **API Integration:** Working with a third-party API (OpenWeatherMap), understanding request structure, and parsing JSON responses.
*   **Data Structuring:** Processing raw API data into a more usable format for display (e.g., grouping forecast data by day).
*   **Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues related to asynchronous operations, data handling, and DOM updates.
*   **Integrating AI-Generated Code:** Learning to understand, modify, and integrate code snippets generated by AI tools into a functional application.
